# Overview
Originally for this project, a Virtual Reality detective game was the first choice.
This game would have been developed with Unity and the Oculus Quest.
Unfortunately, due to PC hardware limitations, it was not feasible to develop a sufficient game.
Many attempts were made to get the game set up, but even basic setups took hours. 
Being a hectic time during the college year, this could not carry on. Time is precious; therefore, improvisation had to be made.
The project's goal was then altered to be a Voice Assistant in Python with AI technologies. 

# Purpose of the Application
